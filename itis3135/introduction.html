            <h3>Personal Background</h3>
            <p>I've lived in Charlotte for as long as I can remember. Enjoy learning about space and tech. In my spare time I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, and watching YouTube videos. </p>
            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>Had a NASA internship in 2020, where I worked on risk management tools. After that I was a clerk at Harris Teeter for a year and a half.</p>
            <h3>Academic Background</h3>
            <p>Attended an early college high school, so I graduated high school and got an associates degree in 2021. Currently a CS student at UNCC.</p>
            <h3>Background in this Subject</h3>
            <p>Started learning HTML and CSS on Codecademy when I was much younger, but just the basics. I've tried my hand at making UIs for some projects in the past, but there is still a lot to learn.</p>
            <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
            <p>M1 MacBook Pro</p>
            <h3>Courses I'm Taking & Why</h3>

                <li><em>ITCS-3145:</em> Seems like an interesting and important topic that I want to learn more about.</li>
                <li><em>ITSC-3146:</em> Interested in learning more about networking after learning a bit in previous classes.</li>
                <li><em>ITSC-3155:</em> Learning about the process of software engineering is very important, and this class will help me build a foundational skill set.</li>
                <li><em>ITIS-3135:</em> I've always wanted to learn a little more about web development and design in general. I learned the basics when I was younger but needless to say there is still a lot of room for improvement.</li>
                <li><em>ITIS-3200:</em> Security and privacy relating to technology seems to be an ever-growing issue in today's world, and I hope to learn more about the ways to protect security and privacy.</li>
