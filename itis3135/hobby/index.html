            <p>Hi! I'm Parker, and I've been fascinated by space and astronomy for as long as I can remember It all started with my favorite book when I was much, much younger - "There's No Place Like Space." Ever since then, I've always been excited about astronomy and wanted to learn more about the subject. One of my favorite memories was attending space camp in Huntsville, Alabama (in the image above).</p>
            <p>I have a telescope I use to look at many things in the night sky, and I've started to explore astrophotgraphy so I can capture the amazing things I see through it. I've been able to see two rocket launches in person - one in Virginia, and another in Florida. I was fortunate to have an internship with NASA in the fall of 2020, where I worked with a department of the Langley Research Center on risk management software to be used throughout various projects and teams within NASA.</p>
            <p>I continue to learn more about the subject as much as I can. Meteor showers and eclipses are what I especially look forward to (some of the events I'm looking foward to this year are in the "Events" tab above.) I hope you can use this website to gain an interest in this "out-of-this-world" hobby!</p>

            <p>Want to learn more about how to get started with astronomy? Here's some great first steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Get involved</strong>: Join a local astronomy group to learn more with like-minded individuals. One great organization in the Charlotte Area is the <a href="https://charlotteastronomers.org/">Charlotte Amateur Astronomers Club (CAAC)</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Start learning</strong>: There's plenty of great resources about various aspects of astronomy, stargazing, spaceflight, and more. There's various <a href="https://astronomy.com/">websites</a> for staying informed, and many YouTube videos and channels that cover almost everything you conld want to know. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA's website</a> also outlines some space-related news.</li>
                <li><strong>Look up</strong>: It sounds quite simple, but to truly appreciate space, it's great to spend time looking at it. Use maps to find various stars and constellations, or find upcoming celestial events to look out for.</li>
                <li><strong>Get a closer view</strong>: Sometimes your eyes arent enough, especially for seeing up-close vies of planets, nebulas, or other far-away objects in space. For this, binoculars or a telescope can be immensely helpful. There's lots of great beginner options available if you would like one yourself, and there's also frequently a telescope available at local astronomy-related events.</li>
                <li><strong>Take some pictures</strong>: Once you've seen some amazing things in space, try some basic astrophotgraphy you can always remember what you saw. In fact, all the space images you can see on the pages of this site were taken by me! Although phones aren't the best for this, they can often be decent enough for some basic picture-taking, especially if used in conjuction with a telescope or other device that can do the zooming-in for you. Most recent phones today also have a built-in long exposure mode that works well for taking wide images of the night sky.</li>

            <p>Astronomy is a subject that has fascinted people for thousands of years. From planets to comets to entire other galaxies, there's always plenty to see and learn more about. We know so much but so little at the same time about what's all around us in space. Gaining an appreciation for our planetary neighbors is an rewarding and exciting process. Seeing a glimpse into the universe is something that's truly special.</p>
            <p>Astronomy as a hobby offers a great sense of community. There's plenty of organizations where you can meet other amateur astronomers and learn more from like-minded people. Astronomy is also a great way to connect with just about anyone, even if they might not have a huge passion for the subject. Anyone can look up at the sky or through a telescope and appreciate what is out there to see, whether it be the grandness of an eclipse or a nearby planet.</p>
            <p>There's always something to learn when it comes to astronomy. Whether it be learning about upcoming celestial events, catching up on the latest finds, or reading more about the science of the universe, there's always more to learn. In fact, there's always new discoveries being made, from far-away galaxies to asteroids and comets right next door. One day, you too could be a part of the next great discovery in astronomy.
