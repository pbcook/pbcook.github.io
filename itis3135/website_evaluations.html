            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.frame.work" target="_blank">Framework</a></h3>
                <p>This is the website for Framework, a company that makes a laptop focusing on repairability and upgradability. The main page showcases the laptop and gives information about the company, and includes links other sections of the site.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The site has clear buttons that stand out from the background, and text, images, links, and other standout elements of the webpages are clearly visible easy to read</li>
                    <li>Repetition: The color scheme, buttons, image sizes, fonts, and other elements of the page are cohesive and work well together. The various parts of the main page follow a consistend standard to make the page esier to digest.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The elements of the page are aligned well to make the contents flow properly. The headers are centered on the page, with images, buttons, and text aligned in their own clearly defined sections.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Separate parts of the main page are clearly defined to keep relevant information together. Elements are given enough room and spaced well to ensure easy readbility.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren</a></h3>
                <p>This is the website for Arngren, a Norwegian store selling a variety of products. A large number of gadgets and items can be seen scattered on the main page, including bikes, binoculars, telescopes, and robotic arms.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Certain color combinations appear jarring and hard to read on the page - for example, green text on a section of an image with a different shade of green, and bright red and yellow text and backgrounds.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: The site uses a seemingly random mix of colors, font sizes, and layouts that make the page extremely disorienting and hard to nagivate. There is very little consistent, cohesive repetition on the page. </li>
                    <li>Alignment: The alignment of the page can best be described by the word "chaos." Overlapping images and text make the page appear as if everything was tossed on the page without caring about what ended up where.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: The page makes it hard to find what information belongs together on the page. Various things are outlined in different sizes and colors, and some completely unrelated items appear next to each other on the page.</li>
                </ul>
