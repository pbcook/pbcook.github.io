                    <li><strong>Gallery:</strong> The gallery will provide a variety of images to showcase the projects the STEM Club is working on, and provide brief context for each image. The page will be used by all users who want to know more about the projects the STEM Club is working on. There won't be data entry, but there may be links to pages going more in-depth about some projects. There will be buttons for navigating through the images in the slideshow.</li>

The page will be used by students who would like to join the club. There will be data entry for the form on the page, and some fields will require validations.
